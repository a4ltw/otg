# **Digital Activism Also Needs Protection:**

## **Seeing the Full Picture of Digital Risk from a Single Act of Goodwill**

### **A Seemingly Ordinary Favor, Fraught with Hidden Risks**

Xiao Ming is a worker at an NGO in Country T. One day, a former partner asked if he could help a civil society group in a Southeast Asian country bypass severe internet censorship, allowing local people to freely access outside information. Although not a technical expert, he was enthusiastic about providing support with data organization, training materials, and website setup.

One day, using his regular home internet connection, Xiao Ming logged into a free website platform with a standard browser and uploaded the content provided by his partner, creating a temporary website. Because he didn't use an anonymous browser, his real IP address, connection time, and operational records were all exposed to monitoring systems.

A few days later, the website was blocked, the partner's account was disabled, and someone was even summoned for questioning by the government and subsequently lost contact. Xiao Ming was shocked that his carelessness had put his partners in danger.

If he had used **Tor Browser** from the start, his identity and location would not have been so easily revealed, thanks to its multi-layered encrypted routing and anonymous traffic forwarding. Tor can effectively prevent governments or internet providers from identifying users from network traffic, protecting him from being tracked. This is a critical protection that ordinary browsers cannot provide.

*   **Role**: As an NGO worker
*   **Need**: I need a secure and anonymous way to share sensitive information
*   **Reason**: To protect myself and my partners from being tracked or retaliated against

### **A Temporary Website Exposed Their Real Identities**

After the incident, Xiao Ming tried to raise his security awareness and began teaching his team to use anonymous tools and encrypted sharing platforms, but he still made mistakes.

Once, to make things convenient for his Southeast Asian friends, he directly posted a Google Drive link in a regular messaging app, setting the permission to "anyone with the link can view," without any encryption. Unexpectedly, these links were easily intercepted by monitoring systems, and the content might even have been indexed by search engines. A few days later, Xiao Ming received an anonymous threatening letter, warning him to stop his assistance.

To prevent similar situations, he started using **PrivateBin**, a tool that can encrypt text and links before sending. Only those with the password can read the content, and it can be set to auto-delete, effectively preventing sensitive information from leaking.

*   **Role**: As an NGO worker
*   **Need**: I need a secure way to share and protect sensitive information
*   **Reason**: To prevent my activities and my partners' safety from being threatened

### **Truly Secure Conversations Start with Choosing the Right Tool**

As the situation escalated, Xiao Ming realized that the communication software he had been using also posed security risks. Although he used Tor to protect his browsing, his communication content could still be intercepted.

After a friend warned him that a strange number was trying to detect their communication records, Xiao Ming began looking for a secure communication tool and finally chose **Signal**. It provides end-to-end encryption, meaning messages can only be read by the sender and receiver, and the server cannot decrypt them. It also supports disappearing messages and screenshot prevention, taking communication security to another level.

Xiao Ming taught his friends step-by-step how to download and use Signal, ensuring their sensitive conversations were not monitored.

*   **Role**: As an NGO worker needing to protect communication privacy
*   **Need**: I need a secure communication tool with end-to-end encryption

### **Securely Transferring Large Files to Prevent Data Leaks**

Xiao Ming and his team needed to securely transfer a large report containing a great deal of sensitive personal data from one office to a partner in a remote area. The file was too large to be sent conveniently via email, and using a cloud drive raised concerns about the data being monitored or intercepted during transfer or storage.

At this point, Xiao Ming remembered **Magic Wormhole**. This tool allowed them to establish an encrypted connection directly between two computers using a short "password" or "wormhole code" to securely transfer files and folders of any size. The data is end-to-end encrypted during transit and does not pass through any third-party servers, significantly reducing the risk of being monitored or intercepted.

### **Cleaning Metadata to Prevent Media Files from Leaking Location**

After publishing photos from an offline event, a partner reminded Xiao Ming that photos can contain metadata (EXIF) such as the date, time, and GPS location, which could expose sensitive information about interviewees or participants.

From then on, he mandated that all media files for external release must first be processed with **MAT2**. This tool can batch-clean metadata from images, audio, and documents, ensuring that published media does not accidentally reveal time, location, or device information.

*   **Role**: As an editor or journalist responsible for media publication
*   **Need**: I need to remove hidden personal data from files before uploading
*   **Reason**: To prevent media files from becoming a source for location or tracking

---

### **Creating an Encrypted Digital Notebook for Sensitive Thoughts**

In his work, Xiao Ming would jot down contact information for interviewees, sensitive observations, or action plans, but he worried that regular note-taking services would data-mine this content.

He found **Notesnook**, a note-taking tool that offers end-to-end encryption. It ensures that even when notes are synced to the cloud, the service provider cannot read them, making it ideal for workflows involving highly sensitive information.
