# Welcome to Open Tech Garage

## About the Project
Open Tech Garage is a project focused on evaluating, analyzing, and testing a wide range of open-source software tools. Our goal is to provide transparent and objective information to help users—especially those with security and privacy needs—make informed decisions. This project is a joint initiative by the Open Culture Foundation (OCF) and the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) IQP program, with support from APC, aiming to combine academic research with practical experience to create a platform for the use and promotion of open-source tools.

## Our Vision and Goals
*   **Comprehensive and Rigorous Assessments:** Including analysis of functionality, security, privacy protection, user experience, and technical maintenance.
*   **Lowering the Barrier to Entry:** Through hands-on installation testing, we provide clear "Installation Difficulty Ratings" and "Hardware/Software Requirements" to help users from various technical backgrounds determine if a tool is right for them.
*   **Continuous Updates and Maintenance:** We constantly adjust and improve our assessment criteria and content based on technological advancements and community feedback.
*   **Promoting Open Source Culture and Collaboration:** We encourage community co-creation to expand the influence and ecosystem of global open-source software.

## Key Features
*   **Installation Difficulty and Requirement Testing:** We personally test the installation process of each tool, evaluating the necessary hardware, system environment, network conditions, and technical skills. This information is presented in an easy-to-understand format so that even less technical users can fully understand if a tool meets their needs before adoption, increasing the success rate.
*   **Multi-dimensional Tool Categorization:** Tools are categorized by application areas such as communication, encryption, privacy protection, and data analysis, allowing users to easily find what they need.
*   **Complete User Guides and Instructions:** We provide support documents at various levels, from introductory tutorials and user manuals to FAQs and deployment guides.
*   **Community Interaction and Contribution:** We welcome users to submit tool recommendations, share their experiences, provide feedback on assessments, and collectively improve the quality of our data.

## Target Audience
*   Individual users with security and privacy requirements.
*   Non-profit and civil society organizations with varying technical backgrounds.
*   Software developers and security researchers.
*   Educational and academic institutions.
*   Government or public service-related agencies.

## How to Get Involved
You can contribute by submitting tool recommendations or assessment data on GitHub, sharing your real-world usage experience and feedback, helping to write or improve user guides and installation tutorials, or participating in community discussions and promotional activities.
