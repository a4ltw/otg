One day, a former partner asked if he could help a civil society group in a Southeast Asian country bypass severe internet censorship, allowing local people to freely access outside information. Although not a technical expert, he was enthusiastic about providing support with data organization, training materials, and website setup.</p> <p>One day, using his regular home internet connection, Xiao Ming logged into a free website platform with a standard browser and uploaded the content provided by his partner, creating a temporary website. Because he didn't use an anonymous browser, his real IP address, connection time, and operational records were all exposed to monitoring systems.</p> <p>A few days later, the website was blocked, the partner's account was disabled, and someone was even summoned for questioning by the government and subsequently lost contact. Xiao Ming was shocked that his carelessness had put his partners in danger.</p> <p>If he had used Tor Browser from the start, his identity and location would not have been so easily revealed, thanks to its multi-layered encrypted routing and anonymous traffic forwarding.

Unexpectedly, these links were easily intercepted by monitoring systems, and the content might even have been indexed by search engines. A few days later, Xiao Ming received an anonymous threatening letter, warning him to stop his assistance.</p> <p>To prevent similar situations, he started using PrivateBin, a tool that can encrypt text and links before sending. Only those with the password can read the content, and it can be set to auto-delete, effectively preventing sensitive information from leaking.</p> <ul> <li>Role: As an NGO worker</li> <li>Need: I need a secure way to share and protect sensitive information</li> <li>Reason: To prevent my activities and my partners' safety from being threatened</li> </ul>"},{"location":"story/#truly-secure-conversations-start-with-choosing-the-right-tool","title":"Truly Secure Conversations Start with Choosing the Right Tool","text":"<p>As the situation escalated, Xiao Ming realized that the communication software he had been using also posed security risks.

It provides end-to-end encryption, meaning messages can only be read by the sender and receiver, and the server cannot decrypt them. It also supports disappearing messages and screenshot prevention, taking communication security to another level.</p> <p>Xiao Ming taught his friends step-by-step how to download and use Signal, ensuring their sensitive conversations were not monitored.</p> <ul> <li>Role: As an NGO worker needing to protect communication privacy</li> <li>Need: I need a secure communication tool with end-to-end encryption</li> <li>Reason: To ensure sensitive conversations are not monitored or intercepted, enhancing our security posture</li> </ul>"},{"location":"story/#securely-transferring-large-files-to-prevent-data-leaks","title":"Securely Transferring Large Files to Prevent Data Leaks","text":"<p>Xiao Ming and his team needed to securely transfer a large report containing a great deal of sensitive personal data from one office to a partner in a remote area. The file was too large to be sent conveniently via email, and using a cloud drive raised concerns about the data being monitored or intercepted during transfer or storage.</p> <p>At this point, Xiao Ming remembered Magic Wormhole. This tool allowed them to establish an encrypted connection directly between two computers using a short \"password\" or \"wormhole code\" to securely transfer files and folders of any size.

It runs entirely on the backend you control, with all encryption and decryption handled in the user\u2019s browser, ensuring zero-knowledge privacy (It is self hostable but there is a public instance available to use). PrivateBin is actively maintained, with regular contributions from its developers and the open-source community. The development status can be tracked via its GitHub repository, where contributors regularly add new features, fix bugs, and update the project to address security vulnerabilities. Updates happen often, although not always at the same time. The frequency of updates is determined by whether vulnerabilities, new features, or community-requested enhancements are found. Security updates and patches are often handled promptly.  The development team is relatively responsive to issues and pull requests on GitHub. If a security vulnerability is discovered, it is typically addressed swiftly, and users can also report them as well. There is limited information about the funding for Private Bin and have no known sponsorships. It is primarily supported by community contributors. 2025-04-16 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2bea (4.30)"},{"location":"tool_comparison/#privacy-search-engine","title":"Privacy Search Engine","text":""},{"location":"tool_comparison/#overview_13","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Quick comparison of key features and ratings:</p> Tool Overall Rating Cost Technical Level Key Features DuckDuckGo \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2bea (4.35) Free Core Beginner Private Search, HTTPS Upgrading, Third-Party Tracker Blocking"},{"location":"tool_comparison/#platform-support_13","title":"Platform Support","text":"Tool Operating Systems Mobile Support Offline Use Languages Usability Rating DuckDuckGo Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Browser Extensions (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera) \u2705 \u274c 70+ languages including Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai, Sinhala, Korean, Kurdish \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (5.00)"},{"location":"tool_comparison/#security-privacy_13","title":"Security &amp; Privacy","text":"Tool Security Features Data Collection License Community Support Security Rating DuckDuckGo No IP Address Collection, No Search History Storage, HTTPS Upgrading, Third-Party Tracker Blocking, Fingerprinting Protection, Cookie Protection, Global Privacy Control (GPC), Open Source Code, No Personal Data Collection Minimal Apache-2.0 \u26a0\ufe0f \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2606 (4.00)"},{"location":"tool_comparison/#maintenance-deployment_13","title":"Maintenance &amp; Deployment","text":"Tool Deployment Type Maintenance Status Last Tested Maintenance Rating DuckDuckGo A service with a local client that's hosted by a third party - You install a client on your device, but it connects to and depends on a remote server Last updated February 21, 2025.

Frequent updates. Developers are active; consistent updates and improvements across certain platforms. Proton developers actively monitor forums like Proton\u2019s Reddit and GitHub issues for feedback, often incorporating suggestions into future releases. Transparency: They publicly communicate upcoming changes (e.g. protocol deprecations) and explain the reasoning behind them. Specific details about the total amount of funding or annual revenue are not publicly disclosed but Proton AG has received funding from various sources over the years. European Commission Grant: In 2017, Proton AG was awarded \u20ac2 million by the European Commission\u2019s Horizon 2020 program to support the development of ProtonDrive.

Although Tor exclusively secures communication within the Tor Browser, many users mistakenly think it encrypts all of their data. Tor does not cover any other apps, like Zoom or Spotify. Tor helps protect your privacy online, but it can't protect you if your device is already infected \u2014 like if someone installed a keylogger or screen recording malware on your computer. Do not log into personal accounts (Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) or download documents while using Tor as it breaks anonymity.</li> <li>Additional Notes: No response</li> </ul>"},{"location":"categories/browser/tor-browser/#submission-information","title":"Submission Information","text":"<ul> <li>Submitted By: shawnp221</li> <li>Submission Date: 2025-05-02</li> <li>Last Updated: 2025-05-02</li> </ul>"},{"location":"categories/data-%26-metadata-redaction/mat2/","title":"MAT2","text":""},{"location":"categories/data-%26-metadata-redaction/mat2/#basic-information","title":"Basic Information","text":"<ul> <li>Tool Name: MAT2</li> <li>Category: Data &amp; Metadata Redaction</li> <li>URL: https://github.com/jvoisin/mat2</li> <li>Description: Mat2 (Metadata Anonymization Toolkit) is designed to remove metadata from files and documents to protect users' privacy.
