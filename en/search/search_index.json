Each category has sub-metrics with assigned weights, and the category score is calculated as a weighted average of its sub-metrics.  ### 1. Operational Functionality (Weight: 10%) | Sub-Metric                       | Data Type | Example Value | |-----------------------------------------|----------|--------------| | Functionality     | Integer (1-5) | 3 | | Localization and Language Support         | Integer (1-5) | 5 | | Mobile Accessibility      | Integer (1-5) | 2 |  ### 2. Usability for Non-Technical Users (Weight: 25%) | Sub-Metric                      |  Data Type | Example Value | |---------------------------------|----------|--------------| | Ease of installation/deployment |  Integer (1-5) | 3 | | User onboarding experience      |  Integer (1-5) | 4 | | Technical experience required   |  Integer (1-5) | 2 |  ### 3. Security &amp; Privacy Strength (Weight: 30%) | Sub-Metric                      |  Data Type | Example Value | |---------------------------------|----------|--------------| | Encryption standards            | Integer (1-5) | 5 | | Resilience against known threats| Integer (1-5) | 4 | | Compliance with security best practices | Integer (1-5) | 3 | | Data minimization               |  Integer (1-5) | 4 | | Privacy policy transparency     |  Integer (1-5) | 5 |  ### 4. Maintenance &amp; Sustainability (Weight: 15%) | Sub-Metric                      |  Data Type | Example Value | |---------------------------------|----------|--------------| | Active development              |  Integer (1-5) | 5 | | Community support               |  Integer (1-5) | 3 | | Funding &amp; sponsorship           |  Integer (1-5) | 2 |  ### 5. Performance Efficiency (Weight: 20%) | Sub-Metric                      |  Data Type | Example Value | |---------------------------------|----------|--------------| | CSO Function                      | Integer (1-5)   | 4 | | Relevance          |  Integer (1-5) | 3 | | Effectiveness |  Integer (1-5) | 2 |  ## Final Scoring Calculation  Each category is scored as a weighted average of its sub-metrics which are just simply added and divided by the number of sub-metrics for that category. The final tool score is then computed as a weighted sum of all five categories:  $$ \\text{Final Score} = (0.10 \\times \\text{Operational Functionality}) + (0.25 \\times \\text{Usability}) + (0.30 \\times \\text{Security}) + (0.15 \\times \\text{Maintenance/Sustainability}) + (0.20 \\times \\text{Performance}) $$  We are planning to create a system that allows users to adjust weights dynamically on a webpage to find tools that match their specific needs. *Coming Soon!*  Data Structure # Data Structure Documentation  This document outlines the data structure used for tool submissions and evaluations in our repository.  ## Overview  Tools are stored in a JSON array where each tool is represented by an object containing various fields that describe its features, capabilities, and evaluation results.  ## Field Descriptions  ### Metadata - `id` (string): Unique identifier for the tool - `date_submitted` (integer): Unix timestamp of initial submission - `date_updated` (integer): Unix timestamp of last update - `submitted_by` (string): GitHub username of the submitter  ### Basic Information - `tool-name` (string): Name of the tool - `tool-url` (string): Official website or repository URL - `category` (string): Tool category (e.g., Browser, Password Management) - `description` (string): Brief description of the tool\\'s purpose - `status` (string): Current status (Active, Inactive, Experimental)  ### Core Features &amp; Compatibility - `core-features` (string): Comma-separated list of main features - `os-compatibility` (string): Supported operating systems - `offline-functionality` (string): \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Partially\" - `mobile-friendly` (string): \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Partially\" - `languages-supported` (string): Supported languages - `technical-level` (string): Required technical expertise (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)  ### Security &amp; Privacy - `security-privacy-features` (string): Key security and privacy features - `data-collection-level` (string): \"None\", \"Minimal\", or \"Extensive\" - `security-privacy-strength-rating` (string): Rating from 1-5  ### Deployment &amp; Technical - `deployment-architecture` (string): How the tool is deployed - `license` (string): License type (SPDX identifier preferred) - `cost` (string): \"Fully Free\", \"Free Core\", \"Subscription Model\", \"One-time Purchase\"  ### Maintenance &amp; Support - `maintenance-sustainability` (string): Description of maintenance status and funding - `community-support` (string): \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Limited\" - `maintenance-sustainability-rating` (string): Rating from 1-5  ### Performance &amp; Ratings - `operational-functionality-rating` (string): Rating from 1-5 - `usability-rating` (string): Rating from 1-5 - `effectiveness-reliability-rating` (string): Rating from 1-5 - `overall-rating` (string): Weighted average of all ratings  ### Documentation &amp; Testing - `full-documentation` (string): URL to complete documentation - `version-tested` (string): Version number tested - `date-tested` (string): Date of testing (YYYY-MM-DD) - `testing-environment` (string): Description of testing environment  ### Additional Information - `limitations-vulnerabilities` (string): Known limitations or security concerns  ## Example JSON   <pre><code>{\n    \"id\": \"example-id-123\",\n    \"date_submitted\": 1744747334,\n    \"date_updated\": 1744750500,\n    \"submitted_by\": \"username\",\n    \"tool-name\": \"Example Tool\",\n    \"tool-url\": \"https://example.com\",\n    \"category\": \"Browser\",\n    \"description\": \"A privacy-focused web browser\",\n    \"status\": \"Active\",\n    \"core-features\": \"Feature 1, Feature 2, Feature 3\",\n    \"os-compatibility\": \"Windows, Linux, macOS\",\n    \"offline-functionality\": \"Yes\",\n    \"mobile-friendly\": \"Yes\",\n    \"languages-supported\": \"English, Spanish, French\",\n    \"technical-level\": \"Beginner\",\n    \"security-privacy-features\": \"Feature A, Feature B\",\n    \"data-collection-level\": \"Minimal\",\n    \"security-privacy-strength-rating\": \"4.5\",\n    \"deployment-architecture\": \"Desktop Application\",\n    \"license\": \"MIT\",\n    \"cost\": \"Fully Free\",\n    \"maintenance-sustainability\": \"Regular updates, community-funded\",\n    \"community-support\": \"Yes\",\n    \"maintenance-sustainability-rating\": \"4.0\",\n    \"operational-functionality-rating\": \"4.2\",\n    \"usability-rating\": \"4.3\",\n    \"effectiveness-reliability-rating\": \"4.4\",\n    \"overall-rating\": \"4.3\",\n    \"full-documentation\": \"https://docs.example.com\",\n    \"version-tested\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"date-tested\": \"2024-03-21\",\n    \"testing-environment\": \"Windows 11, macOS 14.2\",\n    \"limitations-vulnerabilities\": \"Limited to specific use cases\"\n}\n</code></pre>   ## Notes  1.

It runs entirely on the backend you control, with all encryption and decryption handled in the user\u2019s browser, ensuring zero-knowledge privacy (It is self hostable but there is a public instance available to use). PrivateBin is actively maintained, with regular contributions from its developers and the open-source community. The development status can be tracked via its GitHub repository, where contributors regularly add new features, fix bugs, and update the project to address security vulnerabilities. Updates happen often, although not always at the same time. The frequency of updates is determined by whether vulnerabilities, new features, or community-requested enhancements are found. Security updates and patches are often handled promptly.  The development team is relatively responsive to issues and pull requests on GitHub. If a security vulnerability is discovered, it is typically addressed swiftly, and users can also report them as well.
